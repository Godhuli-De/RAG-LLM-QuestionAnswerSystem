# RAG-LLM-QuestionAnswerSystem

This repository contains an implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The project bridges the gap between state-of-the-art generative AI models and precise information retrieval systems, enabling robust and context-aware question-answering.

üß†** Key Features**
1. Retrieval-Augmented Pipeline:

  Combines dense vector search with LLMs to retrieve the most relevant context for a query.
  Ensures accurate and factually grounded responses by referencing external knowledge sources.
2. Generative AI Integration:

  Employs advanced LLMs to generate human-like answers based on retrieved context.
  Handles nuanced queries across diverse domains.
3. Customizable & Scalable:

  Supports integration with custom datasets or APIs for domain-specific applications.
  Scalable architecture for both small and large datasets.
4. Real-World Applications:

  Customer Support: Automated, intelligent assistance for FAQs or troubleshooting.
  Knowledge Management: Efficiently querying vast document repositories.
  Education: Personalized learning through detailed and contextual responses.

**Technologies Used**
Large Language Models: GPT, T5.
Vector Search: FAISS, Pinecone, ElasticSearch.
Frameworks: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers.
